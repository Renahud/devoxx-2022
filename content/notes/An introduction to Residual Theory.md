## The problem
*Why is architechture so difficult?*

We don't know the potential futures of our system but we have to take decisions about the system.

Dialogque betwen the ordered system of the software and the disordered system of the world.
=> HyperliminalSystem

Random events occur un the real world that will stress our model. To counteract this we tend to reduce the scope of the wolrd that interracts with our system, but it's the result of the biaises of the stakholders of the project. Sooner or later, however, something will happen from outside of our bubble and will take us by surprise.

Uncertainty and the Complexity Science

## Residuality Theory

residue = the system after an event that occurs and damages the system.
The next steps will be a function of that residue.

We cannot predict the event, but we can decide the structure of the residue.

### Conscepts from Complexity Science applied to software
### Random simulation

Requirements are like a random simulation of the environments. 

### Kauffman Networks
