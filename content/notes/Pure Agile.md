*Building a culture without **Scrum**, **Kanban** and **XP**.*
by *Lemi Orhan Ergin*


What are the real questions the scrum rules try to solve ?

Agile principles are easy to undersand but difficult to master.

Technical practices need a whole team to adhere to them for them to be effective, needs practice and hard to achieve. 

We heare that AGILE = GOOD

Usually, Agile is explained by implementing scrum, kanban or xp.

On the other hand, some organisations don't care about agile and still succeed.
They care about :
- product
- team
- customers

>Let's abandon the word agile to the people who don't do things, Instead let's use a word that describes whet de do
