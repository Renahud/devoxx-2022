Agile Development = Feedback driven development

## Java
Java is now an old language. It has survived very long and is still relevant.

The pace of java evolution has increased last years. Released every 6 months

It is **NOT** developed in 6 months cycles, some features take multiple years to develop.

IT is **RELEASED** on a ยง months cycle.

**Features get on the release train when their ready, the trains depart every 6 months**

Not committing to features until we know they will really be usefull.
 => feedback is key here

> [!IMPORTANT] True Agility
> Decoupling development cycle from release cycle

Legacy is a funny word, usually it us used for the best things we leave for the next generation. In software dev it usually means technical debt.

Java is still a good legacy for programmers
10M developpers in java
