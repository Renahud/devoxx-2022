It has survived very long and is still relevant.\n\nThe pace of java evolution has increased last years. Released every 6 months\n\nIt is **NOT** developed in 6 months cycles, some features take multiple years to develop.\n\nIT is **RELEASED** on a ยง months cycle.\n\n**Features get on the release train when their ready, the trains depart every 6 months**\n\nNot committing to features until we know they will really be usefull.\n =\u003e feedback is key here\n\n\u003e [!IMPORTANT] True Agility\n\u003e Decoupling development cycle from release cycle\n\nLegacy is a funny word, usually it us used for the best things we leave for the next generation.
